    * added ability to call methods with simple arguments.
        * arguments can be quoted with single or double quotes
        * arguments can be barewords that match \w+
    * added POD for arguments, still a little shady, but a start
    * fixed _unqoute to unquote single or double quoted strings
    * we now tokenize the path string first, simplifying code, easier to maintain
    * fixed bug that made it not possible to have a key with a new line
